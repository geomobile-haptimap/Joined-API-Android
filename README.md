#### WHAT IS JOINED?
Joined helps you to locate your friends outdoors at open-air festivals, crowded mass events and other strange environments. Joined not only shows the location of your friends on a map, it also provides the direction and distance to your friends by sound and vibration.

Joined is available for free at the App Store for iPhone and Google Play for Android.

The project homepage can be found here:

- register and login as a new user
- search and contact friends
- show the location of friends
